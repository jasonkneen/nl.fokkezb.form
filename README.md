# Alloy Form Widget - Documentation

This is the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) repository for the documentation of the [Alloy](http://appcelerator.com/alloy) [Form Widget](https://github.com/FokkeZB/form/tree/master).

* Source code: [https://github.com/FokkeZB/form/tree/master](https://github.com/FokkeZB/form/tree/master)
* Documentation: [http://form.fokkezb.nl](http://form.fokkezb.nl)

## How it is made

The contents of [docs](https://github.com/FokkeZB/form/tree/gh-pages/docs) are generated by [JSDuck](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck) using the inline documentation of the actual widget's [source code](https://github.com/FokkeZB/form/tree/master), its [README.md](https://github.com/FokkeZB/form/blob/master/README.md) and some [guides](https://github.com/FokkeZB/form/tree/gh-pages/guides).

### Documenting documentation

For more information about how I structured the documentation and the process of regenerating it when you contribute to the widget, please read the [documentation guide](http://form.fokkezb.nl/docs/index.html#!/guide/documentation).
